# About

Simulator for the Warp feature in Honkai: Star Rail, including inventory and pull tracking. This is a "for-fun" project mimicking the exciting gacha system while practicing object-oriented programming and designing principles not common on LeetCode.

## Features

- Simulates gacha mechanics with pity and rarity systems.
- Three classic banner types:
  - Limited Character Banner
  - Limited Weapon Banner
  - Standard Banner
- Pull history tracking per banner.
- Inventory display with collected gacha items.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `TestGachaSim` class.

## Future Improvements

- Functional GUI beyond the Java terminal.
- Persistent inventory, history, and settings across sessions.
- Top-up and currency features.
- Load character and light cone data from external JSON files.
- Use an API (e.g., Fandom or wiki scraping) to automatically update the registry with the game's version.

## Credits

- Data and character descriptions sourced from the [Honkai: Star Rail Fandom](https://hsr.fandom.com/).
- Inspired by official Honkai: Star Rail mechanics.
